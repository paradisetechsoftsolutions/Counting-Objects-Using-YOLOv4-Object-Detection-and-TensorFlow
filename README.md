# Counting-Objects-Using-YOLOv4-Object-Detection-and-TensorFlow
  
This repository aims to both detect custom images as well as count them. Project is divided into three phases. 

:sparkle:	**Phase 1:** Yolo Model is created using pretrained yolov4 weights, yolo4 config files and customized dataset (containing pizza and fork images)  
:sparkle:	 **Phase 2:** Yolo created model is converted into tensorflow frozen model  
:sparkle:	**Phase 3:** Detectiion of objects in image and their counting is carried out.  

## Why YOLOV4 not v1, v2 and v3
